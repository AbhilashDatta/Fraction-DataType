# Fraction-DataType
A C++ User-Defined Datatype (UDT) to store Rational Numbers (p/q form fractions). It should behave like the
built-in numerical types (for example, int). 

Concept: Here we outline the basic concept for a Fraction datatype. class Fraction is to be designed
as a UDT representing reduced (normalized) proper fractions (rational numbers) of the form p
q where p, q âˆˆ int, q > 0, and gcd(p, q) = 1.
Most operations available in C++ for int type should be available in their respective syntax and semantics
for Fraction. Some operations (like variants of assignments) have been skipped for simplicity and some
operations (like logical negation) have been given new semantics.
